# C++ Practice Repository  

This repository contains my C++ practice projects and exercises, organized into three main categories: **Fundamentals**, **Object-Oriented Programming**, and **Mini Console Projects**.  

The goal of this repository is to document my journey in learning C++ and to provide reusable and well-structured code for reference.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure  

- **`fundamentals/`**  
  This folder contains beginner-level programs and examples that cover the basics of C++ programming, including:  
  - Syntax and structure  
  - Variables and data types  
  - Loops, conditions, and functions  

- **`object_oriented/`**  
  This folder focuses on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in C++. Projects here demonstrate:  
  - Classes and objects  
  - Encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism  
  - OOP design principles  

- **`mini_console_projects/`**  
  This folder includes small console-based projects to apply and test my C++ skills. Examples might include:  
  - Games (e.g., number guessing, tic-tac-toe)  
  - Utilities (e.g., calculators, file readers)  
  - Simple interactive programs
